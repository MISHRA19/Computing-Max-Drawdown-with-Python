# Computing-Max-Drawdown-with-Python
### Modelling Maximum Drawdown with Python

In the notebook uploaded in the repository we have done the following:

1. Imported the US Equity data between 1926 till 2018.
2. Cleaned and selected the two data series for analysis - Small caps and Large caps.
3. Created a Wealth index on Large cap data.
4. Computed past peaks on the wealth index.
5. Calculated Drawdowns at each data point of the wealth index.
6. Created a Function called Drawdown capturing points 3,4 and 5.
7. Have done a few analysis of historocally known events.
